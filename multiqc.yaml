intro_text: "Custom workflow to account for spike-in scaling"
report_comment: "The workflow aligns reads to a target and spike-in genome with bowtie, deduplicates and excludes blacklisted regions, and produces scaled bigwig files according to the spikein. Afterwards MACS3 is called with default parameters (narrow peaks and no control sample) with PE mode and default cutoffs. Currently, scaling is performed with proper pair counts only, but it can be changed to use all fragments instead."
